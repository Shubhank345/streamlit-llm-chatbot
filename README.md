# streamlit-llm-chatbot
Developed a local Generative AI chatbot using Ollama, LangChain, and Streamlit. The application supports multiple open-source LLMs such as LLaMA 3 and Phi-3, offers a web-based interactive interface, configurable inference parameters, and runs fully offline without relying on paid cloud APIs.
